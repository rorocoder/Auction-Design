## AUCTION DESIGN: PUNISHER EDITION

>"Holy shit this is psychotic" - Kevin when he I sent this to him

###### Bidding
- Item up for bid starts on a low price or zero - the starting bid can match that price
- All subsequent bids must be an increase of the previous bidders amount
- If there are no more bids for 10 minutes after the last bid, the item goes to the last bidder
  1. This timer is set to 30 minutes for the first 3 bids of the auction (in order to guarantee people have time to see the auction is up)

###### Interaction
- Users type in the amount they’d like to bid and press enter to submit it
- All users can see a list of bids and their amounts for each auction
- All users see the timer that counts down from 10 minutes
- Participants of the auction will be decided in the first 30 minutes of the bid, to be entered you must click a button saying “Enter Auction” during that time frame
- There will be a button for all participants saying “I Give Up”, if you click that button then you are barred from participating in the auction anymore and taken off the participant list

###### Timing of Bids
- Bidding may ONLY take place during class blocks 
-While on break, directed study, lunch or after school, you may see all information about the current auction but everyone is locked out of participating
- If the 10 (or 30) minute timer to end the auction has not terminated by the end of the last class block, the timer restarts at the beginning of the next class block
- Timings of classes will be determined through iHW


###### Punishment

- To promote education of course, there will be punishments for those caught participating in auctions if you are supposed to be paying attention in class
- 3 criteria must be met for punishment: 
    1. You must be entered into the participant list of the auction
    2. The auction is ongoing (not during any of the breaks) 
    3. You shut down your laptop (presumably being forced by the teacher to do so) 
- The Punishment: You will be forced to pay your last bid and be barred from participating in the auction anymore. If your last bid happens to be the highest bid, then user with the 2nd highest bid will be considered the top bidder and you will be taken out of the running.
  - Note: You will not be punished for closing your laptop if you clicked the “I Give Up” button at least ONE MINUTE BEFOREHAND
- If caught a message is displayed on the auction to all users saying “ [X Person] has been caught!] ”
- Two leaderboards will be displayed: 
    1. people who have the most amount of punishments
    2. the highest amounts forfeited by users who've been caught
- When punished, users will enter which teacher forced them to shut their laptop. Another leaderboard will be listed with the teachers who punished the people the most
- All amounts paid through punishment will be gathered into a pot, and will be given out as prizes for the next prefect council sponsored tournament (dodgeball, spikeball, chess, ping pong, etc)

## Alternative Proposal

Combine my design with Kevin's, where we play games to bid. That way, it becomes easier to get caught by teachers for bidding.
